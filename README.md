# wp-theme-boilerplate
My personal WP theme boilerplate w/Gulp, ES6 and some handy features

Basic tasks such as watch for scripts and styles have been set up. You can clone the repo into your theme folder, and after 
that you should adjust proxy path in *watch.js* file according to your local folder/theme name, like this:

**proxy: "http://localhost/best-wp-theme-ever/"**

~~proxy: "http://localhost/wp-boilerplate/"~~

------------------------------------------------

Make sure that you have Gulp installed globally:

**npm install --global gulp-cli**

In your project directory, run:

**npm install**

Then run:

**gulp watch**

Enjoy!
